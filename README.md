# Introduction
Bike sharing has become a widely adopted means of transportation in urban areas, with its usage varying based on several factors such as seasons, working days versus holidays, and temperature. The Bike Sharing Dataset available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository encompasses data from 2011 to 2012, detailing the hourly and daily counts of rental bikes in the Capital bike share system, along with corresponding weather and seasonal information. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for examining the impact of these factors on the demand for bike sharing.

Seasons play a significant role in bike sharing usage, as people tend to be more inclined to ride bikes during warmer months. Moreover, the distinction between working days and holidays can also influence bike sharing demand, as people's transportation needs differ on these occasions. Additionally, temperature emerges as a crucial factor affecting bike sharing usage; extreme heat or cold may deter people from opting for bikes.

In conclusion, the Bike Sharing Dataset provides essential insights into how seasons, working days versus holidays, and temperature can influence bike sharing demand. Analyzing this data enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing bike sharing usage and offers valuable information for enhancing bike sharing systems to better cater to user needs.
